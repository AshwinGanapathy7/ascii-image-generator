# ASCII Image Generator

## Description:
Here I made a program that converts an image to ASCII that can be printed within the terminal. It is a fun, small project. The main key in such a program is choosing the right characters with the right densities to represent parts of the image. I used AI to generate me the characters in order of most to least dense. I learned a lot about the pillow library and image processing with python. I built this hoping to convert a picture of myself into ascii for my portfolio website.

## How to use:
Download an image that you want to use and set the file path within the program. Run the code and the ascii image will be generated which you can copy into a txt file if required.
